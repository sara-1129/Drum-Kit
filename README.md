# 🥁 Drum Kit Web App

Welcome to the **Drum Kit** – where smashing your keyboard (or clicking buttons like a maniac) actually *makes music*!  
This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that lets you play drum sounds using your keyboard or mouse. Built with 💙, caffeine, and a little bit of chaos.
